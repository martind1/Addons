This zip file contains a Delphi 4 (and 5) version of Allen Miller's Curve 
Fitting routine (from: the book "Pascal Programs For Scientists And 
Engineers", typed and submitted to MTPUG in Oct. 1982 by Juergen Loewner,
and corrected and adaptated for Turbo Pascal by Jeff Weiss.

I have updated these routines to work with  Delphi 4's open array 
parameters. which allows the routine to be generalised so that it is 
no longer hard-coded to make a specific order of best fit or work with 
a specific number of points.
